        <h3>Cardiovascular Exercise</h3>
        <p>Cardio workouts are aimed at improving the health of your heart and lungs. They typically involve activities that increase your heart rate and breathing, such as running, cycling, swimming, or using cardio machines like treadmills or ellipticals. These workouts can help improve endurance, burn calories, and boost overall cardiovascular health.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="class-card">
        <h3>Strength Training</h3>
        <p> Strength training focuses on building muscle strength, endurance, and power. It involves using resistance, such as weights, resistance bands, or bodyweight, to challenge your muscles. Common strength training exercises include squats, deadlifts, bench presses, bicep curls, and lunges. Strength training not only helps increase muscle mass but also improves bone density, metabolism, and overall functional strength.</p>

      <div class="class-card">
        <h3>Flexibility and Mobility Workouts:</h3>
        <p>Flexibility and mobility exercises aim to improve your range of motion, joint flexibility, and overall mobility. These workouts often include stretching, yoga, Pilates, and mobility drills. Stretching exercises help lengthen muscles and improve flexibility, while mobility exercises focus on moving joints through their full range of motion to enhance joint health and prevent injury. Incorporating flexibility and mobility work into your routine can improve posture, reduce muscle stiffness, and enhance athletic performance.</p>
