        <h3>Strength Training</h3>
        <p>This type of weightlifting focuses on increasing the maximal force output of the muscles. It typically involves lifting heavy weights for fewer repetitions (usually 1-6 repetitions per set) with longer rest periods between sets. The primary goal is to increase muscle mass, improve strength, and enhance overall power. Exercises like squats, deadlifts, bench presses, and overhead presses are common in strength training routines.</p>

      <div class="class-card">
        <h3>Hypertrophy Training</h3>
        <p>Also known as bodybuilding, hypertrophy training aims to increase muscle size. It involves lifting moderate weights for moderate to high repetitions (usually 6-12 repetitions per set) with shorter rest periods between sets. The emphasis is on achieving muscle fatigue and creating metabolic stress to stimulate muscle growth. Exercises often include a variety of isolation movements targeting specific muscle groups, such as bicep curls, tricep extensions, and leg extensions.</p>

      <div class="class-card">
        <h3>Endurance Training</h3>
        <p>This type of weightlifting focuses on improving muscular endurance and stamina. It involves lifting lighter weights for higher repetitions (usually 12 or more repetitions per set) with minimal rest between sets. The goal is to enhance the muscles' ability to sustain contractions over an extended period. Endurance training can benefit athletes involved in activities requiring prolonged muscle exertion, such as distance running, cycling, or swimming. Exercises may include bodyweight exercises, circuit training, and high-repetition resistance</p>
